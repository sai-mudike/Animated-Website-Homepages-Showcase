🌐 WebPage Clones without Responsive Design

Welcome to the WebPage Clones without Responsive Design repository! In this collection, I'm dedicated to reproducing the captivating home pages of various websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a primary focus on design accuracy rather than responsiveness. 

🚀 Exploring Design and Code Details

In this repository, I want to recreate the feel of various website designs with careful attention to detail.. By bypassing responsive design considerations, I can focued on the detailed structure, exact styling, and interactive parts that set each website apart.
