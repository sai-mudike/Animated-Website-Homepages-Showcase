👋 Hi there!

I've got something cool in my GitHub repository. It's like a treasure chest where I've recreated a webpage from a place called Sidcup Family Golf 🌐. You know, it's like making your own version of a puzzle!

To make it all happen, I used some special tools like HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. These are like the building blocks that make websites look and behave in certain ways.

Feel free to take a look at what I've done. You'll find how I made things move and look interesting on the page. Remember, this is a way for me to learn more about how websites work 💻🚀.

If you're curious about the original inspiration, check out the Sidcup Family Golf website here: https://sidcupfamilygolf.com/.

Have fun exploring, and feel free to drop by anytime to see what I've created! 🏌️‍♂️🎨
